# The Vecternary Project

<image here>

Vecternary is a project to build a open-source and minimalist design tool. It's also meant to be an alternative to Adobe Illustrator, and a lighter alternative to Inkscape. Vecternary is capable of working well with both vector and raster design workflows.

As Vecternary is an open source project, it is provided for free, but you can support development by buying the app on Gumroad for a symbolic price. No subscriptions, ever.

## Overview

Design software has come a long way from its inception, and over time, it has become more approachable and familiar. But still, most design software today is intended for a professional user base, and is consequently packed with features that distract less-experienced users from working creatively. They are too cluttered with panels and widgets, and don't focus enough on the bare essentials. And all of those extra tools and features have the unfortunate side-effect of making these apps heavy in filesize (gigabytes often), slow to load, laggy to use, and memory-hogging.

Put it simply, we believe that *minimalism is a feature*.

## Project Objectives

Vecternary should be able to achieve the following goals:

- Fast file loading
- Fluid editing and reliable performance under limited system resources
- Fault tolerance (that is, progressive enhancement and graceful degradation in combination)
- User-friendly UI design
- Keybindings supplementing well-considered UX for fast workflow
- Hassle-reducing for the user (e.g. with autosaving/auto-backups/crash auto-recovery)
- Global reach and accessibility

Vecternary should **avoid** the following issues:

- Feature bloat
- Customization bloat (opinionated is good, we don't want 1000 ways of doing the same thing)
- Overuse of plugins (Vecternary should be completely usable without plugins)
- Security vulnerabilities (e.g. mitigated with sandboxing and denial of injected script execution)

## Roadmap

The Vecternary Project is in heavy development and will see its first release in approximately October of 2021. Here's a timeline of events:
