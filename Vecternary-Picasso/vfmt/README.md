# Vfmt

Due to Vecternary being a polyglot application, written in several programming languages, existing formatters can be strechted to their limits. It addresses the following limitations:

- The unconventional codebase
- The single-language nature of Rustfmt
- The depedency of NPM required by Prettier and HTML-Beautify
- The lack of Markdown formatting support and Rust formatting support by nearly all other formatters

Vfmt is written using memory-safe C++ as with the rest of Vecternary's tool ecosystem.
