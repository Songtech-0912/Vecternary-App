            <p>You're seeing this because you've disabled JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Don't worry, JavaScript used by Vecternary is no draconian surveillance tactic! It's only there to
                provide canvas editing functionality. It also runs in a sandbox and it can't access the internet or
                collect analytics data. Where possible, as little JavaScript is used as possible, but
                because core parts of the user interface are written in JavaScript, I can't guarantee that
                <em>anything</em> will work correctly without JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Vecternary is designed to protect your privacy - that's not an advertising tagline, it's truly
                designed to be privacy-centric software. For instance, unlike most software, Vecternary has no
                telemetry or spyware; the only thing it connects to the internet for (and <em>only</em> if you
                enable this feature) is syncing the online assets and plugins library.</p>
            <p>In addition, Vecternary is fully compliant with the Free Software Foundation's free/libre software
                guidelines. You can see a list of scripts that are used by Vecternary, along with their licenses,
