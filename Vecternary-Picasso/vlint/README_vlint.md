# Vlint

Vlint is Vecternary's standard linter. As part of the Vecternary philosophy, it serves as a minimalist, functional-first, lightweight module that does one thing well - in this case, making sure all of Vecternary's code abides to strict standards.

## Features

* **No dependencies** - Vlint is written entirely in C++ in a [specific C++ dialect](https://github.com/node-dot-cpp/memory-safe-cpp) that makes sure it is memory-safe
* **Formats and prettifies code** - Vlint doesn't just check code for errors, it also prettifies code with sane defaults
* **Applies automatic fixes** - Vlint has the option to apply automatic fixes back into the code, saving tons of time needed to manually refactor code
* **Excellent debug support** - Vlint traces errors cleanly to the root of the issue, and indicates both downstream and upstream potential issues caused by a code error
* **Feature-complete** - Not too much, not too little, but just enough features to work well with Vecternary's ecosystem.

## Enforced Standards

Vlint enforces standards for Markdown, YAML, HTML, CSS, JS, Rust, Python, C++, C, and (Bash) shell.

### Markdown

* Vlint follows essentially the same Markdown rules as Nmlint (Natron Markdown), just with a better-optimized implementation
* Vlint's Markdown ruleset is described in [this specification](https://hackmd.io/@natron-dev-awesome/SyqUwnN_u)

### YAML

### HTML

* HTML should conform to W3C validation standards
  * Vlint will have parity with the [Nu W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) in this regard
* No inline JS - that is, all javascript code should be linked from external files
* In all other matters, Vlint follows the standards of <https://codeguide.co/>

### JS

* There are no source code comments starting with `TODO`
* There is a comment every 3 lines, and a docstring in every function
* Memory-slowing and memory leaking code as per [documented best practices](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/writing-fast-memory-efficient-javascript/)
* JavaScript file names should be in `camelCase`
* Scripts are lazy-loaded and each script is meant for one specific function
* Static type-checking prevents undefined variables (and makes sure files are loaded in order, preventing non-DOM loaded undefined vars by static-checking)
* Variables should use `let` and should be in camelCase
* Constants should use `const` and should be in `camelCase` unless if the constant is a global variable, which should be in `UPPERCASE`
* Classes should be in `PascalCasing`
* Functions should be in `camelCase`
* Use template literals in string concatenation
* Use arrow function unless if in a deeply nested function or in a function with a dynamic context
  * All functions must have default parameters
* Always use curly braces in a control structure
  * Make sure that the curly brace starts on the same line with space in between
  * Even if a function is a one liner, move the function contents to a newline
* No function should have more than 1 level of nesting
  * A deeply-nested function should be changed to use a switch statement
* Functions should have a maximum of 20 lines of code
* Use the `!` shortcut instead of using `== false` when writing booleans
* Use the strict equality operator `===` when appropriate as much as possible
* In all other matters, Vlint follows the standards of <https://javascript.plainenglish.io/19-simple-javascript-coding-standards-to-keep-your-code-clean-7422d6f9bc0>

### CSS

* Total CSS should be < 50 KB in size
* The universal selector `*` is not allowed
* When CSS is not auto-generated by Tailwind, additional rules apply:
  * Applying resets to styles should be minimized; it makes for redundant CSS
  * Setting `display: block` for fixed or absolute-positioned items; the [HTML Reference](https://htmlreference.io/) site has information on when it is appropriate
  * Using `transform` outside of animations or transitions
  * Using 100% width or full width if it is redundant
  * Setting children of a flex container to flex
  * Using complex CSS rules when a `margin: auto` does the job
* Unused CSS is warned of but not removed (removing unused CSS/JS code is the specialized job of Vbundler, not Vlint)
