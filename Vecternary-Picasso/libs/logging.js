// logging.js
// Custom library by @Songtech-0912 for the purpose of serving as an alternative to console.log
// (But the difference is that it logs to not just the web console, but also to the Rust terminal
// STDOUT as well as to a log file called ~/.vecternary.log)
console.log("Starting error logging - messages starting with [ERROR] are error messages");
